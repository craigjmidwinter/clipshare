## Workspaces

### Creating Workspaces

**Q: What's the difference between a Producer and Collaborator?**

A: **Producer**:
- Creates and manages workspaces
- Invites collaborators
- Controls workspace settings
- Can export OBS packages
- Has full administrative control

**Collaborator**:
- Creates bookmarks and notes
- Views and collaborates on content
- Downloads individual clips
- Cannot modify workspace settings
- Cannot invite other users

**Q: Can I change a workspace from one piece of content to another?**

A: No, workspaces are tied to specific Plex content (episode, movie, etc.). To work with different content, create a new workspace.

**Q: How many collaborators can I add to a workspace?**

A: There's no hard limit, but performance is optimal with 5-10 active collaborators. Larger teams may experience slower real-time updates.

### Workspace Management

**Q: Can I delete a workspace?**

A: Yes, producers can delete workspaces they created. **Warning**: This permanently removes all bookmarks and associated data. Consider exporting important content first.

**Q: What happens if the producer leaves the organization?**

A: Contact your administrator to transfer workspace ownership or export important data before the producer account is deactivated.

**Q: Can I duplicate a workspace?**

A: Not directly, but you can:
1. Export bookmarks as data
2. Create a new workspace with the same content
3. Manually recreate important bookmarks
4. Use this for template-style workflows
